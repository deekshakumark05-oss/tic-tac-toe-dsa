# Tic Tac Toe Game using Stack (Data Structures)

## Project Description
This project is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate Data Structure concepts, specifically the implementation of **Stack** using push and pop operations.

The application allows two players to play alternately and provides an undo feature implemented using stack operations.  
This project helps in understanding how core computer science concepts can be applied in real-time web applications.
